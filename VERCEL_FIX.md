# Fix Vercel Frontend Deployment

## The Problem
Your Vercel frontend is not working because the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not properly configured.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your `rabuddy-frontend` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add New**
5. Add:
   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://rabuddy-backend.onrender.com/api`
   - **Environment**: Select "Production" (and "Preview" if you want)
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Redeploy
1. Go to the **Deployments** tab in your Vercel project
2. Click the **"⋯"** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**

### Step 3: Wait and Test
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Visit https://rabuddy.abhiranmultani.com
- The frontend should now load and be able to connect to your backend

## Quick Test
Your backend is working fine:
- ✅ Backend Health: https://rabuddy-backend.onrender.com/health
- ✅ CORS is configured correctly
- ✅ API endpoint available: https://rabuddy-backend.onrender.com/api/test

## Alternative: Push Code Changes
If the above doesn't work, you can also push the code changes I made:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix frontend deployment configuration"
git push
```

This will trigger a new deployment with the `.env.production` file I created.

## Why This Happened
- Vercel doesn't read environment variables from `vercel.json` anymore
- You need to set them in the dashboard or use `.env.production` files
- Your backend was working all along - it was just a frontend configuration issue
