  ],
  "status": "success"
}
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration Needed

The RAG system is working perfectly! It found 8 relevant sources from your PDF documents. You just need to add the LLM API key:

### **In Render Dashboard:**

1. Go to your Render service dashboard
2. Click on **Environment** tab
3. Add this environment variable:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY = your_google_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

### **Get Gemini API Key:**
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy and paste into Render environment variables

## 📊 Deployment Status

### **Current Status** ⏳
- ✅ Code deployed to GitHub
- ⏳ Render redeployment in progress
- ⏳ Waiting for new backend to be live

### **Expected Timeline**
- 2-5 minutes for deployment
- Test endpoints should return 200 OK
- RAG functionality should work with API key

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

```bash
# Test 1: Check deployment status
bash test_backend_connectivity.sh

# Test 2: Check RAG system status  
curl -s https://rabuddy-backend.onrender.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "RABuddy Production", 
  "rag_available": true,
  "pdf_available": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-28T11:04:36.510417"
}

# Test 3: Test document retrieval
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the guest policies?"}' \
  https://rabuddy-backend.onrender.com/api/query
```

## 🎯 What Your Frontend Will Get

Your frontend will now receive:
- ✅ **Real answers** from PDF documents (with API key)
- ✅ **Source citations** with page numbers
- ✅ **Fallback responses** when LLM unavailable
- ✅ **Proper error handling**

## 📚 Available Documents

Your RAG system has indexed these PDFs:
- 📄 `2024-2025 Paraprofessional Duty Manual.pdf`
- 📄 `Emergency Evacuation Assembly Areas Synopsis.pdf`
- 📄 `FA24 Duty Protocol Snapshot.Parapro.pdf`
- 📄 `HDS Emergency Evacuation Assembly Areas.pdf`
- 📄 `University Housing Residence Hall Prohibited Items.pdf`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait for Deployment** (2-5 minutes)
2. **Add GEMINI_API_KEY** in Render dashboard
3. **Test Your Frontend** - should work perfectly now!
4. **Ask Real Questions** like:
   - "What are the emergency evacuation procedures?"
   - "What items are prohibited in residence halls?"
   - "What are the guest policies?"
   - "How do I contact emergency services?"
